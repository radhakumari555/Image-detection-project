What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

Kernels are generally used for extracting the feature of any object.we use kernel on any object to filter its feature and whatever we obatin after filtering an object we put that part in the channel.In this way we can filter an object many times through kernel and we will obtain different features everytime.In this way we can built our final output.

Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

we use 3x3 kernels because it is smaller in size,by using smaller size kernels we get low weight numbers and large number of layers.It will help to get result in more efficient way. we can use 3x3 kernel to extract each small feature which will help to create a proper output.In case of large kernels we will not get the output more accurately as compared to 3x3 kernel.
